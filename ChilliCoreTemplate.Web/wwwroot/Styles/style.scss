    How Inspinia Fits into the App
    -------------------------------

    ~/Styles/inspina/base is untouched from the original installation (keep it that way!)
    However, the inspina stylesheet entry point is now ~ /Styles/inspinia/customised.scss. It's copied from ~/Styles/inspinia/style.scss and modified to:

    1. Include the _patch and _app.scss files
    2. _variables.scss is copied from the inspinia base dir and moved to ~ /Styles/inspinia/ - and will have more variables which are important to patch/app.scss
    3. Remove uneeded styles: landing page
